Just wanna write this thread in English for a change.

Cryptocurrency is booming these days, as a person who works in technology field, 
I was asked about it many times.

I would like to say that we are not familiar with these system about you can profit from it.
Those who work in financial field should vastly understand it more than us.

We are like road worker, they know how to make a road safe and effective.
But they might not understand what business of those who use the road do.

We might understand basic _cryptograpghy_ (not cryptocurrency), how blockchain works, and what type of fraud it can prevent (and what it cannot).

But if you want to know how you can make money from it, I think you better ask a banker.
